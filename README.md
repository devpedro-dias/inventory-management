# Inventory Management System

## Overview

The Inventory Management System is a Java-based project designed to efficiently manage inventory operations. This project aims to apply and challenge my Java skills, creating a robust and professional-grade application. The system includes functionalities such as managing products, categories, orders, and movements (entries and exits) of inventory.

## Objectives

- Apply and solidify Java programming skills.
- Develop a comprehensive understanding of Spring Boot, JPA, and RESTful APIs.
- Create a professional-grade application suitable for real-world scenarios.

## Features
